# LaserHarp-code

This is the code for all the laser harp programming - the Arduino code, the Raspberry pi.

Hopefully this is useful for anyone wanting to create their own laser harp or for fellow students who are planning to continue the project.

The code to run the basic functions of the laser harp is individualTesting which should be run on the Arduino and LizPlayingModeUpdate is the code to be run on the RaspberryPi.
